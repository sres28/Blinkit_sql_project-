# Blinkit Sales Analytics & Optimization Project ðŸššðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes Blinkitâ€™s sales and customer behavior data to uncover growth opportunities and improve decision-making.  
Using MySQL, I explored customer spend, product categories, and sales patterns to provide data-driven recommendations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Questions
1. Which customers contribute most to sales?  
2. Which product categories are most profitable?  
3. Which products drive the majority of revenue?  
4. How does sales performance vary month-over-month?  
5. When are customers most active (day/hour)?  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- MySQL (Advanced SQL: CTEs, Window Functions)  
- Data Analysis & Visualization (PPT, Excel)  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Orders**: order details (order_id, customer_id, delivery_time)  
- **Order_Items**: product-level details (product_id, quantity, price)  
- **Products**: product info (name, category)  
- **Period**: 2023â€“2024  

## ðŸš€ Key Findings
