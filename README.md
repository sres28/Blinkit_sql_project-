# Blinkit Advanced SQL Project ðŸššðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes Blinkitâ€™s data to identify customer segments and optimize marketing strategies.  
Advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs and window functions were used to extract meaningful business insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objectives
- Identify **first-time buyers** in the current month
- Detect **customers with low feedback ratings**
- Segment customers who buy only from specific categories
- Analyze **most active shopping days** per customer
- Track **month-over-month spending trends**
- Rank customers by **total spend**
- Identify **high-value, frequent, and inactive customers**
- Find customers with **high average order value**
- Highlight the **most frequent buyers** overall

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- SQL (MySQL)
- Advanced Queries: CTEs, Window Functions, Joins, Aggregations
- Data Cleaning & Transformation

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Tables used:  
- `Customers`  
- `Customer Feedback`  
- `Orders` & `Order Items`  
- `Inventory`  
- `Marketing Performance`  
- `Delivery Performance`

## ðŸš€ Key Insights
- A small % of customers contributed disproportionately to total revenue  
- High-spend and frequent customers overlapped, but not fully â€” useful for different targeting strategies  
- Negative feedback correlated strongly with **delivery delays**  
- Month-over-month analysis showed consistent growth from repeat buyers  
- Some product categories were bought almost exclusively by niche customers
